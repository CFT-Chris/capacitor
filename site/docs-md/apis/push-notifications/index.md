# Push Notifications

The Push Notifications API provides methods for registering a device to receive notifications from a server, along with processing received notifications and responding to them. In contrast, the [Local Notifications](../local-notifications) API provides means for offline, local notification scheduling and processing.

## Enabling Push Notifications Capabilites

*Ios*:
On iOS you must enable Push Notifications Capabilities in your project to enable the Push Notifications plugin to work. To do so, go to the `Capabilities` section of the app project and switch the `Push Notifications` button from `OFF` to the `ON` position.

This change adds the push capabilites to the app and creates an entitlements file in the project.

*Android*:
On Android just download the app project's `google-services.json` file from the Firebase console, and place it in the  `projectName/android/app` folder.

*PWA*:
For progressive web apps, go to `Project Settings` in the Firebase console. In the `General` section, copy the web app's Firebase config from `Firebase SDK snippet` and paste it as `serviceWorker.firebaseConfig` in `capacitor.config.json`. Under the `Cloud Messaging` section, generate a new VAPID `Key Pair` under `Web configuration`, and provide the value to `serviceWorker.firebaseConfig.vapidKey`. See example `capacitor.config.json` below:

```
{
  "appId": "app.capacitor.my",
  "appName": "My Capacitor App",
  "serviceWorker": {
    "name": "capacitor-sw.js", // Optional
    "combineOtherWorker": "ngsw-worker.js", // Optional
    "firebaseConfig": {
      "apiKey": "ABC123def456-GHI789jkl012-MNO345pqr678",
      "authDomain": "mycapacitorapp-abc123.firebaseapp.com",
      "databaseURL": "https://mycapacitorapp-abc123.firebaseio.com",
      "projectId": "mycapacitorapp-abc123",
      "storageBucket": "mycapacitorapp-abc123.appspot.com",
      "messagingSenderId": "1234567890",
      "appId": "1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456",
      "vapidKey": "ABC123def456-GHI789jkl012-MNO345pqr678"
    }
  },
  "npmClient": "npm",
  "webDir": "www"
}
```

If the app has an existing service worker, provide its location (relative to `webDir`) to `serviceWorker.combineOtherWorker` in `capacitor.config.json`.

After production builds of the app, ensure to run `npx cap copy web` from the command line. This will copy Capacitor's service worker to the `webDir`. The service worker will have the necessary handlers for web push notifications and will include `combineOtherWorker` if provided. `npx cap copy web` will also copy `capacitor.config.json` to `webDir` to provide Firebase its configuration.

Ensure that the app uses `capacitor-sw.js` as its service worker. The service worker filename generated by `npx cap copy web` can be overridden with `serviceWorker.name` in `capacitor.config.json`.

In an Angular PWA, for example, the following code in `app.module.ts` will use `capacitor-sw.js` as a service worker:

```
import { ServiceWorkerModule } from '@angular/service-worker';

/* ... */

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ServiceWorkerModule.register('capacitor-sw.js', { enabled: true })
    /* ... */
```

## Push Notifications icon

On Android, the Push Notifications icon with the appropriate name should be added to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_icon" android:resource="@mipmap/push_icon_name" />
```

If no icon is specified Android will use the application icon, but push icon should be white pixels on a transparent backdrop. As the application icon is not usually like that, it will show a white square or circle. So it's recommended to provide the separate icon for Push Notifications.

Android Studio has an icon generator you can use to create your Push Notifications icon.

## Disabling Push Notifications plugin

If you are not using Push Notifications in your project, when you submit the app to iTunes Connect, Apple will send you an email saying it has issues because of `Missing Push Notification Entitlement`. That happens because Capacitor includes the code for registering for push notifications and getting the token.

Apple sends that mail just to make sure you didn't make a mistake and forgot to enable Push Notifications Capabilities in your app, but can safely ignore it if you are not using the Push Notifications plugin.

In case you don't want to receive the mail, you can disable the Push Notifications plugin by removing `USE_PUSH` from `Active Compilation Conditions` in your project's Build Settings section.

## Push notifications appearance in foreground

On iOS you can configure the way the push notifications are displayed when the app is in foreground by providing the `presentationOptions` in your `capacitor.config.json` as an Array of Strings you can combine.

Possible values are:
* `badge`: badge count on the app icon is updated (default value)
* `sound`: the device will ring/vibrate when the push notification is received
* `alert`: the push notification is displayed in a native dialog

An empty Array can be provided if none of the previous options are desired. `pushNotificationReceived` event will still be fired with the push notification information.

```json
"plugins": {
  "PushNotifications": {
    "presentationOptions": ["badge", "sound", "alert"]
  }
}
```
